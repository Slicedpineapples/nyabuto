**Nyabuto Portfolio Overview**

Welcome to Nyabuto's comprehensive portfolio â€”a dynamic website crafted with HTML and CSS for the frontend, providing an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. 
The robust backend is powered by PHP, ensuring seamless functionality and tight security. 
I skillfully incorporated JavaScript tricks to enhance the user experience and deliver additional functionalities.

A notable feature of this portfolio is the inclusion of a **system flow diagram**, providing a visual representation of the project's architecture and workflow. 
This adds depth to the understanding of the project and also showcases my attention to detail and commitment to clarity in design.
